If you're using it to obtain books for your studies, your job or just for those cold winter's nights when you're tucked up in bed, any amount you wish to donate towards future development will be greatfully received.

As an added bonus, you'll get access to new beta versions before they're released publically.  Unless you don't want them, of course."""

eBooks are a great resource for everyone.  Unfortunately, if you're blind or visually impaired (or even if you're not), accessing them using the software or devices of your choice can be a challenge.  That is the challenge Codex aims to overcome.

With Codex, you can take the books you've legally purchased from sites like Amazon, Smashwords, popular eBook stores using Adobe Digital Editions or Barnes & Noble via NookStudy and convert them to a format of your choice, be it ePub for reading on the latest devices, plain text to read in good old Notepad or any of the of the other supported output formats.  This involves automatic removal of software protection imposed on such files, and a separate conversion process.  However, the two steps can be performed with one convenient menu command, right from Windows Explorer.  Alternatively, if no conversion is required, you can choose to remove the protection and leave the original format intact.

Even if your files aren't DRM-protected and can already be read, Codex serves as an easy, efficient, accessible general purpose eBook converter and organiser, so why not give it a go!

To get started, you can [check out the feature list](#features), [download the installer](#donate), or [have a read of the online documentation](http://jscholes.net/project_files/codex/readme-en.html) which is also available from within the Codex Help menu.  If you're interested in accessing Kindle books using Codex but don't quite know how to go about it, I've written a [guide on that exact topic](http://jscholes.net/how-to-remove-drm-from-kindle-books-with-codex/).  And if you have any questions, don't hesitate to get in touch [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/JamesScholes) or [via email](mailto:%6a%61m&#101;&#115;@ja%6de%73s%63%68ol%65%73.&#99;%6f%6d).
